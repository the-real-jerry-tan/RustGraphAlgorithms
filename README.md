# Rust Graph Algorithms

This project demonstrates classical graph algorithms like BFS, DFS, and Union-Find in Rust, built using Cargo. 

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `cargo build --release` to compile the project.
3. Use the Dockerfile for running the project in a container.

## Future Development
- Add more algorithms like Dijkstra's and Kruskal's.
